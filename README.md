# AVR_robot
A Robot (Autonomous Driving) building project with Jaeho Hwang, Yeonjay Choi (2013. 09 ~ 2014.08). We designed this robot from very basic by ourselves. We used Atmega128 with AVR Studio as Controller &amp; System Supervisor, OpenCV (2.4.8) for Real-time Image Recognition (Stop, Start Sign and Arrow Direction Recognition), and Arduino Uno for Dead Reckoning Algorithm. Additional Sonar sensor and IR sensor are used in our robot. Here we provide source codes and some parts of demo video. Unfortunately, we could not implement SLAM in out robot, since we had no idea about the technique during our undergraduate.
